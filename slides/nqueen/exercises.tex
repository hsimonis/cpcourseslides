\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a program for the 0/1 model of the puzzle as described above. Explain the problem with introducing a dynamic variable ordering for this model.
\item It is possible to express the problem with only three \texttt{alldifferent} constraints. Can you describe this model?
\item What is the impact of using a more powerful consistency method for the \texttt{alldifferent} constraint in our model? How do the search trees differ to our solution? Does it pay off in execution time?
\item Describe precisely what the \texttt{reorder} predicate does. You may find it helpful to run the program with instantiated lists of varying length. 
\item The credit search takes two parameters, the total amount of credit and the extra number of backtracks allowed after the credit runs out. How does the program behave if you change these parameters? Can you explain this behaviour?
\end{enumerate}
